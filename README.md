__**Info**__
Welcome to Drazden and Dark's modding hub. You probably know me from my work on Wabbajack. Currently I develop Heartland Redux for Oblivion. I used to maintain the Wabbajack Port of Through The Valleys. I also sometimes do New Vegas stuff. TDarkShadow is a former maintainer of Viva New Vegas (and Best of Times and Midnight Ride) and also works on Wabbajack (Don't bother him about Elder Scrolls stuff.) This is the current home for our modding stuff. Please join our discord for support and discussion.
